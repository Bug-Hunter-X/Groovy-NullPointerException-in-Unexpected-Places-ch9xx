# Groovy NullPointerException in Unexpected Places

This example demonstrates how Groovy's dynamic typing can make NullPointerExceptions harder to detect compared to statically typed languages.  The issue arises from implicit type coercion and the lack of compile-time null checks.

The `bug.groovy` file contains code that might seem correct at first glance but can easily throw a `NullPointerException` in certain situations, particularly with deeply nested object structures.  The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a solution illustrating best practices for handling potential null values in Groovy.

## Reproducing the Bug

Run `bug.groovy`. You may find that the assertions pass with some null values, but you should be able to modify the inputs to trigger a NullPointerException.
